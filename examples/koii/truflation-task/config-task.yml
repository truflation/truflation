task_name: 'Inflation Monitoring'
author: 'Truflation'
description: 'Truflation (see truflation.com) tracks inflation using real world data to inform governments and policy-makers around the world. Run this task to help Truflation gather key information from travel websites. In addition to helping governments understand and control inflation, this task will also reward you with KOII every time your computer helps to gather data from the internet. Rewards are proportional to the work done, and the amount of time your computer is online, so donâ€™t worry about staking a lot of tokens here. Note: Please hold at least 0.3 KOII in your staking wallet to ensure your staking account.'
